-   Solo/SmallTeam developers have a wide variety of skills.
-   With varying levels of mastery for each of those skills.
-   Some very focused, some not so much.

Some skills I noticed:

-   Artistic vision (atmosphere, visual, audio, music)
-   Programming: Execution, quality and optimization
-   Game design
-   Project management
