I'm me.

** Professional Work

*** Fonts @ Google

November 2025 - Present

I'll be working on fonts. I'm a fonts guy now.

*** Gigantic Data, Huge @ Google

June 2016 - October 2025

I've worked on gigangic data within Google on the Seach Analytics team. It was
fun times as I evolved from a junior engineer to an effective senior tech
lead. In my role I:

- Stared at flamegraphs and dashboards to optimize and find headroom.
- Re-architected dataflows for efficiency and simplicity.
- Maintained great docs to facilitate onboarding and design discussions.
- Lead teams to deliver over-complicated software.
- Try to understand the real problems we are trying to solve.

** Hobby Work

*** Audio

I'm a small time maintainer of a few Rust crates. They could use more care, but
they work well enough.

- [[https://github.com/wmedrano/livi-rs][Livi]] - A library for running [[https://lv2plug.in/][LV2]] audio plugins.
- [[https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-jack][rust-jack]] - Rust bindings for the JACK audio API. Basically the go-to
  real-time audio/midi IO library.
- [[https://github.com/rustaudio/wmidi][wmidi]] - MIDI encoding and decoding library for Rust.

*** Programming Languages

I am working on [[https://github.com/wmedrano/szl][Sizzle]], a Scheme interpreter written in Zig. It is currently
/usable/ and well on its way to [[https://r7rs.org/][R7RS]] small compliance. At some point, I'll
probably tear it down and recreate it with a [[https://cranelift.dev/][cranelift]] backend for better
performance.
