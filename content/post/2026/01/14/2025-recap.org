* Scheme Interpreter

I actually started writing an interpreter in Zig (and Rust) in 2024. In 2025, I
did a few more attempts and got a little farther.

I implemented a lot of the [[https://r7rs.org/][Scheme R7RS]] in Zig as opposed to some custom
spec. This was great because I got to focus a lot on the implementation and not
the design. Designing a language involves so many unimportant decisions. I also
learned some stuff that is specific to Scheme. The most difficult bits to
internalize and implement were continuations and dynamically scoped
variables. The most difficult thing that I have left is the controversial
dynamic unwind.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the progress. Implementing the Scheme spec was
insightful, though I don't see myself finishing the implementation. However, I
might reboot the effort and start a new interpreter.

* Self-Hosted Git + JJ

** ForgeJo

For my meaningless personal projects, I use my self-hosted [[https://forgejo.org/][ForgeJo]]
instance. ForgeJo is very /fast/, light, and works pretty well. I'm a sucker for
responsiveness, so I love that pages and git operations happen instantly. On the
downside, I really notice the latency when using other source control systems.

** JJ

I also switched from Mercurial and Git to purely [[https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj][jj]]. I didn't have gripes with
Mercurial or Git, but I appreciate being able to use just jj. jj is sort of a
frontend to Git and also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_(source_control_system)][Google's Internal Source Control]].

Bonus:
- It's really fast with Google's source control compared to the Mercurial
  wrapper.
- The model is an upgrade over Git and Mercurial.

One important lesson from jj is that parasitic systems win. Even if a version
control system is better, it will have a hard time displacing Git. jj is
partially successful because it builds on top of Git. Other examples I can think
of:

- Kotlin/Clojure/Scala on JVM ecosystem.
- Typescript on JavaScript.

* 3D Printer

I got a 3D printer, the Prusa Mini+! Very cool, I can see why they were so hyped
up over 10 years ago. I've printed and painted some cool figures. Hopefully this
year I can learn Blender and CAD to make better use of it.

* New Job

🎵New Job🎶New Job🎵

I started a new job on the Google Fonts team in November. After 9 years of being
on Big Data processing, it felt strange to move to something complete
different. However, after 2 months, I no longer feel like being a "data person"
is in my bones.

The new job is great, though my performance has been mixed. Some days I feel
confident and capable, other days I feel like a beginner again. But I'm making
steady progress and expect things to smooth out soon.
