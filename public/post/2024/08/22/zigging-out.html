<p>
As a Rust developer, I've had it. I've designed my last type system,
hacked around my last borrow/ownership issue and will claim back some
CPU cycles. Hyperbole aside, I've been developing with Rust since
early 2016 and have mostly enjoyed it. The type system and ownership
model has been good for my development as a programmer. It has made me
aware of many common memory issues and race conditions. Prior to this,
I was used to debugging segfaults and invalidated objects in C++ and
sometimes Go. In the beginning, Rust lacked lots of library and had an
ecosystem that was easily eclipsed by the more mature
languages. However, at this point, I consider it to have one of the
most polished ecosystem in certain niches. Some of my favorite
libraries include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://ratatui.rs/">https://ratatui.rs/</a> - TUI library.</li>
<li><a href="https://rapier.rs/">https://rapier.rs/</a> - Physics engine.</li>
<li><a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/#language-bindings">https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/#language-bindings</a> - Parsing
library built in C, but has a great Rust API.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite how good Rust is, I'm reaching for a new low level programming
language. The main reason for this is to try something new, but there
are some things about Rust I'm happy to take a break from like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Large refactors. Rust's rigid type system (where lifetime is part of
the type) often necessitates more rewrites than other programming
languages I'm comfortable in (namely Go/C++/Clojure).</li>
<li>Some things are a hassle in plain Rust. Something like implementing
a garbage collector feels very wrong in Rust. <code>unsafe</code> can be used,
but it doesn't feel quite as "Rusty".</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="orge079259"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.2.</span> Why Zig</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
This is arbitrary. I've heard of Zig. I've listened to some random
talks. The creator, Andrew Kelley seems like an enthusiastic guy. I
was able to <code>sudo dnf install zig</code> and things worked without much
friction. This is a great recipe to get started. For some real
reasons, here are some things I like about Zig:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good C interop story. If there's something that I don't want to
write, I can probably reach for a C library.</li>
<li>Its low level. As a control freak, I like to know my function call
stack, where allocations happen, and how my memory is laid
out. Every once in a while I get the urge to pick up something like
Kotlin, but I know I'd miss the low level mental model too much.</li>
<li>Developer velocity is valued. From interviews, it seems that getting
fast iteration times VIA fast compile times is a priority.</li>
<li>It's an underdog language. Zig is the passion project of Andrew
Kelley and is not funded by a major corporation. Despite this, Zig
has a few people working on it full and has developed a great
language.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="org09c9a1b"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.1.</span> Lazy Compiler</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<p>
Zig has one of the laziest compilers. During compilation, only things
that are referenced are compiled. Additionally, some things can be
evaluated at compile-time which may prune some code paths from even
compiling. The following still compiles!
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-zig"><span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-variable-name">Struct</span> = <span class="org-keyword">struct</span> {
    <span class="org-variable-name">x</span>: <span class="org-type">i64</span> = 0,
    <span class="org-keyword">pub</span> <span class="org-keyword">fn</span> <span class="org-function-name">badFunction</span>(<span class="org-variable-name">self</span>: *<span class="org-type">Struct</span>) <span class="org-type">void</span> {
        <span class="org-keyword">return</span> self.y;
    }
};

<span class="org-keyword">pub</span> <span class="org-keyword">fn</span> <span class="org-function-name">main</span>() <span class="org-type">void</span> {
    <span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-variable-name">s</span> = Struct{};
    <span class="org-keyword">if</span> (<span class="org-constant">false</span>) {
        s.functionThatDoesNotExist();
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>badFunction</code> should not compile as <code>Struct</code> does not have a member
called <code>y</code>. However, it is not referenced so Zig prunes its
compilation.</li>
<li><code>s.functionThatDoesNotExist()</code> is known to never be called, even at
compile time. The <code>if</code> statement is evaluated over a <code>bool</code> that is
known at comptime. It's evaluated and the dead code path is
eliminated.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I did not expect the Zig compiler to be extremely lazy. In this sense,
it reminds me of a scripting language. I expect compiled languages to
not compile on the above. A scripting language would still run, but it
would fail at runtime if one of the bad code paths is taken. Zig is
somewhere in the middle. The program compiles because Zig determines
that the codepath is unreachable. However, compilation fails if <code>if
(false)</code> is changed to <code>if (true)</code> or <code>badFunction</code> is referenced.
</p>

<p>
I think I know why this feature exists. The standard library itself
has lots of conditional compilations.  For example, <code>switch
(builtin.os.tag)</code> is evaluated at compile time. There are lots of dead
branches for each of the non-target OS branches.
</p>

<p>
Do I like this? It's definitely necessary for the way that Zig handles
metaprogramming. In practice this is annoying under the following
scenario:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I have a function definition that is unused.</li>
<li>I make breaking changes to an API. This affects the unused function
definition.</li>
<li>I use the "unused function". It's somehow broken.</li>
</ol>


<div id="orge9253aa" class="figure">
<p><img src="shocked-pikachu-face.png" alt="shocked-pikachu-face.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Although annoying, this hasn't been a deal breaker. Perhaps future
tooling will help with this use case.
</p>

<p>
So are there any advantages to the laziness? Can it lead to faster
compile times? At the moment, I don't know. It seems like compiling
just what's needed could be good. Especially for a scenario where
there is a large code base, but you just want to test a single
scenario. At work, I commonly wait for our large code base to compile
gigabytes of unused data just for my tiny test case. It's a large
source of developer unvelocity.

<div id="outline-container-org287bb92" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org287bb92"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2.</span> Explicit Memory Allocations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
In Zig, memory allocations are explicitly managed. You pass in the
appropriate allocator for each function call. Generally you want to
use an instance of <code>std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator</code>, but in in
tests, you should use <code>std.testing.allocator</code> identify and debug
memory leaks.
</p>

<p>
Zig was the first time in years I've had to worry about cleaning up
memory, and I did not do well. With some time, I improved at least a
little bit. My current flow for memory management is:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write the code. Throw in some lazy cleanup code with <code>errdefer</code> and
<code>defer</code>.  a. While writing, think about what unit tests I should
write.</li>
<li>Write the unit tests. Depend on <code>std.testing.allocator</code> to provide
debug details on memory leaks.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Memory leaks were the most common error. The hardest cases to clean up
was partially built objects whose construction was aborted due to an
error. Not that bad, but sometimes I did have some deadly use after
frees to debug.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-1-2-2-1-1">
<p>
For a quick refresher, a program may ask the memory allocator for
memory each time it is called. The memory allocator uses some
algorithm along with syscalls to give the program memory. Once the
program no longer needs the memory, it gives it back to the memory
allocator at which point the memory allocator can give it back to the
OS or reclaim it for later use (or leave it unused due to heavy memory
fragmentation).
</p>

<p>
Each memory allocation and deallocation in the fancy allocator has
some performance impact. However, things become simpler in an
arena. The memory arena is essentially a block of memory. When the
program requests memory, then it is received from the next block of
memory. The interesting part is that when the program wants to give
back memory to the arena, nothing happens. The trick to arena is that
the memory must be freed all at once. This simplifies the memory
allocation strategy since:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Allocations require simple pointer increments in the block of
memory.</li>
<li>Deallocations have no cost.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Arenas are typically clunky in programming languages. I've used arenas
a few times, and it has always felt awkward each time. Arenas usually
come in when trying to squeeze every last bit of performance out of
code so it never occurred to me that arenas could be clean.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orge8e6197"></a>Arenas In Practice<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-1-2-2-1-2">
<p>
Arena's are usually used when trying to squeeze out every little bit
of performance out of a program. In the instances I've tried, arenas
have been very clunky. I've tried out Go arenas (experimental) which
did not support arenas for <code>map</code> objects and <code>C++</code> protobufs which
were ok-ish. The interesting part about the protobuf use case is that
our dataset was very nested. However, the arena data was embedded into
each proto message. I didn't look at the internals, but over a lot of
objects, having a pointer may add up and destroy some cache locality.
</p>

<p>
The clunkiness such as Go <code>map</code> not being supported and <code>C++</code>
protobufs requiring extra overhead is partly because memory allocators
are taken for granted. In 99.99% of use cases, some default allocator
should be used. However, for the extra use cases, not enough room has
been made to fit in the implementation.
</p>

<p>
In Zig, it was pretty trivial to put in an arena in some cases. This
is because Zig encourages passing allocators instead of relying on an
implicit builtin. In some callsite, I had a collection of <b>big</b> one
time allocations and many small allocations. Slapping on an arena
allocator was trivial. Instead of passing the <code>self.allocator()</code>
object that was in scope, I wrapped things in an arena:

<h4 id="orge7d8ab7"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.3.</span> No Interfaces, we have ducktyping at home</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-3">
<p>
Most languages that take generic parameters have the concept of an
interface. For example, in Rust, double speak for an <code>Animal</code> can be
implemented like so:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-rust"><span class="org-keyword">pub</span> <span class="org-keyword">trait</span> <span class="org-type">Animal</span> {
    <span class="org-keyword">fn</span> <span class="org-function-name">speak</span>(<span class="org-rust-ampersand">&amp;</span><span class="org-keyword">self</span>);
}

<span class="org-keyword">impl</span> <span class="org-type">Animal</span> <span class="org-keyword">for</span> <span class="org-type">Duck</span> {
    <span class="org-keyword">fn</span> <span class="org-function-name">speak</span>(<span class="org-rust-ampersand">&amp;</span><span class="org-keyword">self</span>) { <span class="org-rust-builtin-formatting-macro">println!</span>(<span class="org-string">"quack!"</span>) }
}

<span class="org-keyword">fn</span> <span class="org-function-name">double_speak</span>(<span class="org-variable-name">a</span>: <span class="org-rust-ampersand">&amp;</span><span class="org-keyword">impl</span> <span class="org-type">Animal</span>) {
    a.speak();
    a.speak();
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the above, the <code>double_speak</code> function can be implemented by any
type. If you want to create an <code>Animal</code>, it's easy to read the trait
specification and implement it. If something goes wrong, a helpful
compiler error is displayed.
</p>

<p>
In Zig, there is no explicit contract, it is implicit. The
implementation of the above would be:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-zig"><span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-variable-name">Duck</span> = <span class="org-keyword">struct</span>{
    <span class="org-keyword">pub</span> <span class="org-keyword">fn</span> <span class="org-function-name">speak</span>(<span class="org-variable-name">_</span>: *<span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-type">Duck</span>) <span class="org-type">void</span> {
        std.debug.print(<span class="org-string">"quack!"</span>, .{});
    }
};

<span class="org-keyword">fn</span> <span class="org-function-name">doubleSpeak</span>(<span class="org-variable-name">animal</span>: <span class="org-type">anytype</span>) <span class="org-type">void</span> {
    animal.speak();
    animal.speak();
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the Zig version, <code>doubleSpeak</code> takes a type that can call
<code>speak</code>. You know that by reading the <code>doubleSpeak</code> implementation and
not by reading an interface spec. When I started with Zig, interfaces
were my most wanted feature. After more experience, I'm not even sure
that I want some sort of interface system. Zooming out, the main
benefits from interfaces are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can code to the interface definition which is defined in one
place. With Zig, you have to read some documentation or the function
implementation to find out what to implement. On the other hand,
should I be programming to adhere to interfaces? Is this a large
value add?</li>
<li>Usually good compiler errors. Interfaces can give you <code>Duck does not
  implement Animal</code>. In Zig, you get a long stack trace and a message
along the lines of <code>Duck has no callable function speak</code>. Overall,
this last point doesn't need interfaces per se. The real feature
request is having generally useful compiler errors.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-4">
<p>
In most languages, metaprogramming feels compeletely different than
the language it is programming for. In Zig, <code>comptime</code> is very much
built in Zig. You can have compile time functions that return a
type. Implementations can check type info to produced different code
paths where the alternative branches are pruned before producing a
compile error. It's very fluid.

I've only seen some simple stuff for now, but am looking forward to
exploring the library of <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Builtin-Functions">functions available at comptime</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5a89c95" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5a89c95"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.5.</span> C Interoperability (untested)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-5">
<p>
Zig's C interoperability is clean. Unlike many object-oriented
languages that wrap C concepts in classes with automatic cleanup, Zig
uses <code>defer</code> and <code>errdefer</code> to manage resource cleanup.
</p>

<p>
This approach eliminates the need for boilerplate adapters often seen
in other languages' C library wrappers. For example, if a C function
provides a <code>newThing</code> function and a <code>deleteThing</code> function, you can
use:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-zig"><span class="org-keyword">var</span> <span class="org-variable-name">x</span> = newThing();
<span class="org-keyword">defer</span> deleteThing(x);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In C++, developers commonly wrap the API to make it more C++-like. The
C++ version of the API may involve writing the following boilerplate:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-c++"><span class="org-keyword">class</span> <span class="org-type">ThingWrapper</span> {
  <span class="org-keyword">public</span>:
    <span class="org-function-name">ThingWrapper</span>() {
        m_thing = newThing();
        <span class="org-keyword">if</span> (<span class="org-negation-char">!</span>m_thing) <span class="org-keyword">throw</span> <span class="org-constant">std</span>::runtime_error(<span class="org-string">"Failed to create thing"</span>);
    }

    ~<span class="org-function-name">ThingWrapper</span>() {
      <span class="org-keyword">if</span> (m_thing) deleteThing(m_thing);
      m_thing = <span class="org-constant">nullptr</span>;
    }

  <span class="org-keyword">private</span>:
    <span class="org-type">void</span>* <span class="org-variable-name">m_thing</span>;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
C dependencies in Zig should in theory involve normal import and
use. No boilerplate or redesign is needed to make the API to be
Zig-like. Of course, I have not yet tried this so my experience may
change when actually using it in anger.

<h4 id="org1cb4fe7"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.6.</span> Tooling</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-6">
<p>
My main setup is Emacs + LSP + <code>M-x compile</code>. Overall, the Zig tooling
is usable, but I'm looking forward to more polish in the future.

<li><a id="orge5199ee"></a>Build System<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-6-1">
<p>
Although Zig is pre-1.0 and subject to changes, its build system has
gained traction, even being adopted by large companies like <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/bootstrapping-ubers-infrastructure-on-arm64-with-zig/">Uber</a>. In
addition to building Zig executables, it includes a C compiler and
supports cross compilation.
</p>

<p>
The Zig build system is centered around a <code>build.zig</code> file that
is&#x2026; written in Zig and defines commands. I've done basic things like
<code>zig build test</code> and <code>zig build run</code>, but to be honest, I haven't yet
got the right mental model for it yet. Install? Executable? Run
Artifact? At some point, I'll probably have to learn the build system
to include dependencies, especially C deps. Hopefully the
documentation is good. I'm not saying that the build system is
overkill for Uber, just that I haven't had to build any complex
programs in Zig yet.

<li><a id="org16c61a2"></a>ZLS - LSP<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-6-2">
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/zigtools/zls">ZLS</a> is Zig's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">language server</a>.
</p>

<p>
ZLS is pretty usable but the compile checks need more work.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Formatting - Works as well as <code>zig fmt</code> does.</li>
<li>Autocomplete - Misses some stuff, but still useful.</li>
<li>Go to definition and find references mostly works. This was actually
great when programming. The biggest benefit I got was quickly
jumping to the definition of items in the standard library. The Zig
standard library not only has information that is immediately
useful, but it is also a good example of how to program in Zig.</li>
<li>Compile check - It performs some checks, but misses a lot. Seems
like it only performs basic checks on the AST instead of what the
compiler would check. Not really that useful yet.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org595c50e"></a>Compiler Checks<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-6-3">
<p>
The biggest pain point was ZLS syntax checking. The main workaround to
this was to use Emacs' built in <code>compile</code> function which allows me to
run a build or test and jump around to the source code for any errors
that are parsed.

<li><a id="org2fd92b9"></a>Performance Tooling<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-6-4">
<p>
My main project in Zig is building an interpreted programming
language. I started <a href="https://github.com/wmedrano/spore">Spore</a> in Rust. Although the implementation is
slow, I had a fun and easy time using the following performance
tooling:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion">cargo criterion</a> - Measure execution time and make fancy plots.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph">cargo flamegraph</a> - Build flamegraphs to see where the bottlenecks in
my program are.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately, <code>cargo criterion</code> is specific to Rust so I resorted to
manually measuring execution time with <code>std.time.Timer</code> or even the
linux <code>time</code> program.
</p>


<div id="orgba3ddc0" class="figure">
<p><img src="criterion.png" alt="criterion.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I expected a tool like <code>cargo flamegraph</code> to work, but the result was
basically unusable. <code>cargo flamegraph</code> uses <code>perf</code> to collect
telemetry from a program and then renders the results as a flamegraph
in SVG format. It was able to, but all the functions/symbols were
unlabeled.
</p>


<div id="orgb76bef3" class="figure">
<p><img src="flamegraph.svg" alt="flamegraph.svg" class="org-svg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I'll probably look more into this area. Zig's creator <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1501">seems to use
Valgrind</a> for some performance testing.
