I'm Will Medrano. I work as a Senior Software Engineer at Google. I deal with
very big data during my day job, but in my spare time I tinker with a variety of
things like:
- The Rust programming language.
- Audio for music creation purposes.
- Ergonomic keyboards.

** Notable Open Source Work

*** Rust JACK

https://github.com/rustaudio/rust-jack is a Rust wrapper over JACK. JACK is the
recommended Realtime audio API for Linux.

*** wmidi

https://github.com/rustaudio/wmidi is a midi encoding and decoding library. Midi
is a widely used digital interface to communicate musical data such as note
keypresses and parameter changes.

*** livi-rs

https://github.com/wmedrano-livi-rs is a Rust library for hosting LV2 plugins.

** Rust Essential Libraries/Functionality

The libraries or functionality I use in most Rust projects.
- logging
- command line flags
- easy parallelism (rayon)
- CI with building, testing, linting, and releasing.

These are also useful in some contexts:

- performance monitoring

** Takeaways from Watching Game Devlogs

- Solo/SmallTeam developers have a wide variety of skills.
- With varying levels of mastery for each of those skills.
- Some very focused, some not so much.

Some skills I noticed:

- Artistic vision (atmosphere, visual, audio, music)
- Programming: Execution, quality and optimization
- Game design
- Project management

** Tour of My Mechanical Keyboards

I have

- Keyboardio Model 01 and Keyboardio Model 100
- Ergodox EZ
- ZSA Moonlander
- Preonic - The only non-split, but still ortholinear keyboard.
- Iris

My current daily driver is the Iris.
